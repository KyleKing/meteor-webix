# Meteor+Webix CRUD example

First you need to download the submodules. In the main directory (i.e. the parent of `examples`), run:

    git submodule update --init

Then `cd examples/crud` and run `meteor`.

A live demo is at http://webix.meteor.com.

## Changing skins

Run

    meteor remove webix:skin-flat
    
and add another [available skin](https://atmospherejs.com/?q=webix%20skin) instead, such as:

    meteor add webix:skin-web
